Do It That Way
==============

This site will show you the *correct* way of doing things that you probably
think you do the right way already.

Users can sign in with Facebook and submit videos for publishing. The videos
will then be placed in a queue for moderators to review and publish if
applicable.

Once a video is published, users can comment on a video and vote on a video.

## Admin users
Admin users can add admin and moderator access to any user by going to thhe
"Users" link on the menu bar while logged in as an admin.

## Moderator users
Users must be granted moderator access by a site admin before they will have
moderator priveleges. Moderators can publish and unpublish videos. If there are
unpublished videos that need to be reviewed, a moderator will see a pulsing red
notification on the menu bar while logged in as a moderator.
